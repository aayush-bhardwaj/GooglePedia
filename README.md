## INTRODUCTION
---

The journey to prepare yourself for "THE INTERVIEW". The Big 4.

* Google
* Facebook
* Microsoft
* Amazon

There are a lot of other Cool companies, but believe me if you hold the Offer letter from any of the two Big 4.

Trust me you are good enough to crack any interview.

So, I start writing this book on 29-06-2017 and with 186 days left in 2017 the plan is to get ready for Big 4 by EOY.

This is not a book to be followed by absolute beginners to crack the GOOGLE interview, rather it's a journal that an aspiring GOOGLER is maintaining towards his journey to becoming GOOGLE fit.

I will track my progress on a per day basis for the next 186 days.
